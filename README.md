This project analyses the relationship between house prices and income for first-time buyers, highlighting the overall affordability trends. The interactive dashboard provides insights into how house prices compare to income levels, offering a visual representation of housing affordability challenges.


## Project Overview
In this project, I examined how house prices and income levels for first-time buyers have evolved, focusing on the disparity between the two. The primary objective of the dashboard is to give users a clear view of the house price to income ratio and provide insights into how this ratio affects the affordability for new homeowners.

## Key Insights
Some of the key insights available through the dashboard include:

- **Affordability Ratio**: The ratio of house prices to income highlights how difficult it is for first-time buyers to enter the housing market.
- **Price Trends**: House prices have increased disproportionately compared to income growth, leading to reduced affordability over time.
- **Income Lag**: While house prices have been increasing, income levels have not kept pace, widening the affordability gap.

## Features
The dashboard includes several interactive features:

- **Affordability Ratio Visualisation**: A clear comparison of how house prices stack up against income levels for first-time buyers.
- **Year-over-Year Trends**: Users can track the changes in house prices and income levels over time to understand long-term trends.
- **Tooltips**: Hover over different data points to view specific details about house prices, income levels, and the corresponding ratio for any given year.

## Technologies Used
- **Tableau**: Used for creating and designing the interactive visualisations.
- **Excel**: For data processing and preparation.

## How to Use the Dashboard
To explore the dashboard:

- **Affordability Comparison**: Observe the affordability ratio by comparing the house price and income lines on the graph.
- **Historical Trends**: Use the timeline on the dashboard to see how the affordability ratio has shifted over the years.
